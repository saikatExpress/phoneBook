            <h3>Education : </h3>
            <p>
                I am the only son of my father. As such, my parents tried hard to make me study well. My primary education
                started before I was five years old. In 2005, I got general scholarship in primary scholarship examination,
                which is first and unprecedented in our area. .My primary school was Kandarp Bashati Government Primary
                School.Then my father enrolled me in a local lower secondary school for sixth standard.In that school I
                studied till seventh standard.
                Later my father admitted me to Mymensingh Mukul Niketan High School in class VII. I studied in that school
                till class IX. Then my father again admitted me to Datta School, a reputed school of my district. Then I
                passed secondary from this school. Then higher secondary. I came to Mymensingh again to study. I got
                admission in Royal Media College. I passed higher secondary in 2013. My father's heart was broken because
                the result was not as expected. I was also disappointed.
                After some time at home, I decided to enroll in a private university. I was admitted in a university in
                Uttara, Dhaka. I could not pass from this university named IUBAT. Again, disappointment. B.Sc is completed
                in Computer Engineering.After one year gap, I got admission again in Sonargao University of Dhaka. Then in
                December 2022, I completed my B.Sc in computer engineering.
